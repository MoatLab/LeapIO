# LeapIO: Efficient and Portable Virtual NVMe Storage on ARM SoCs

Due to some special reasons, we couldn't publicly share LeapIO source code on
github. Currently, MSR is maintaining the code base. If you are interested,
feel free to contact Anirudh Badam (anirudh.badam@microsoft.com) to get access
to it. Please also feel free to contact Huaicheng Li (hcli@cmu.edu) for any
questions.

Thanks for checking this!
